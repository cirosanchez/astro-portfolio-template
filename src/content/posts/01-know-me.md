## Hello! 

Hello, im Ciro, a passionate developer from Colombia. 

My main programming language is <span style="color: #faa152">Java</span> but i also know C#, C++, Python and few more.

I started programming in 2021, with python and won a #11 place on a national competition, after that i got interested on Minecraft, especially plugins this brought me to SpigotMC and Java, where i learnt
not only how to code plugins, but also, how to be in a big community and interact with foreign.

Since that day i've been coding almost every day, with every type of projects.
